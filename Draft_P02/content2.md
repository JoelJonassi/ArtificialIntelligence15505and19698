# Introduction

This practical work intends to increase the knowledge acquired during Artificial Intelligence classes through dataset analyse.
It is intended from certain characteristics, to try to identify the group to which the animal belongs, namely: Aquatic, predators, mammals, flying, birds, etc.

Metadata of the dataset used in the projetc:
animal_name, hair, feathers, eggs, milk, airborne, aquatic, predator, toothed backbone.


# Automatic classification

• Define the business goals to be achieved;

• Select two algorithms and the parameters to be used;
• Present the data selection criteria and explain how the data was prepared;
• Apply the ML algorithms and evaluate the generate models;
• Optimize the selected algorithm.
Document the intermediate and final results>>



# Clustering

### The business goals to be achieved:

- Group the animals according to the similarities between them;

### Present the data selection criteria and explain how the data was prepared:

-

### Apply and evaluate the K-Means algorithm:

-

### Optimize the algorithm parameters.

## Intermediate and final results



# Association rules

### Define the business goals to be achieved;

### Present the data selection criteria and the data preparation steps;

### Apply and evaluate the Apriori algorithm, adjusting the algorithm parameters.

## Intermediate and final results

# Results Analysis

<< Present an analysis of the results obtained in the previous sections based on performance metrics. Include a link to a Git repository with the code developed under the project >>

# Conclusion

<<Include the lessons learned from the execution of the project.
The structure of the report should be adapted according to each project characteristics. Don’t forget to remove these comments (help text)!>>
